Hello! Thank you for visiting.

Every day, I think about how to make software better and then I talk to colleagues and type code to achieve that goal.

I do this mainly with Trinny London as part of a growing dev team. Then I spend time learning and having fun with side projects (like this one!) whenever I can.
