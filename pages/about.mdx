I love working in tech and that is what I do these days, but it wasn't always the case.

Born in a Portuguese middle-class family, I was always exposed to computers. I have fond memories of Prince of Persia, installing the first CD-ROM reader in my PC and of course, that sweet (but expensive!) sound of dial-up internet in the late 90s.

Later I began experimenting with HTML and CSS sites, and feeling the limitations of Dreamweaver.

Once in university, Computer Science was the obvious path for me. Perhaps too obvious... because despite being a top student, I decided to drop out of my degree to pursue the arts instead! That's right - my younger self, bored with the easy life, went to study Filmmaking in London and eventually become a video producer first in the UK movie scene, and then in Switzerland in the global humanitarian field for 5 years.

But I never felt comfortable in that path, nor did I love my work. It was hard to find motivation sometimes, and because it was simple enough to make ends meet, I never pushed for bigger career goals.

Luckily, the best thing happened - **I had a daughter**! And suddenly, time was scarce, making ends meet was a challenge, and I needed laser focus to survive in this new role. Necessity truly is the mother of invention!

It was time to dust off my programmer's hat and unlock the potential of what was always my calling. I got busy studying whenever I could, starting with the amazing CS50, followed by Flatiron School's incredible bootcamp and finally landing a job with Stylist magazine in London.

The career switch has paid off spectacularly, and I now love what I do. I enjoy helping others around me see the beauty and creativity of working in tech, and to this day I still have a relentless drive to learn and improve.
